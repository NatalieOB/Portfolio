<strong>The Ask:</strong> The leadership team wanted to communicate that Incorporating sustainable business practices isn’t a onetime investment—it’s a dynamic commitment that requires constant attention and improvement. Wanted to showcase this through a brochure that would foster the hope to enhance the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of all stakeholders in the Commonwealth community.

<strong>The Process:</strong> The CSR report began with an initial kickoff meeting that included all individuals and departments involved in the request. I worked alongside a copywriter to focus the attention to the data and visuals that adhered to the message of sustainability of what this publication was set to deliver. It was the firms belief that there was an interconnectedness between our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment and our success—two outcomes that shouldn’t be viewed as mutually exclusive. Rather, by embracing sustainable principles and continuously improving upon their existing practices.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> A design solution was created that was able to span a digital PDF report and a web page. All touchpoints incorporated design elements exclusive to the report while reinforcing the Commonwealth visual branding.
