<strong>The Ask:</strong> Design a logo that resembles graffiti art for use on an accent wall in the client's studio. My client requested a black font on a pink background and a rainbow of paint splatters, like the intentional flickering of a paintbrush.

<strong>The Process:</strong> I researched the greater Boston area for inspiration in my first round of sketches. While sketching several concepts of the graffiti styles that inspired me, I considered my client's persona and the customers who visited her studio. Her logo must also be impactful, memorable, and not too distracting. I created several versions utilizing spraypainted techniques for the graffiti motif.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> After several iterations, which included refining my sketches and communicating with my client, we ended up with an intentional and impactful design. Through close collaboration with my client, I developed a logo that was versatile and specific to her brand.
