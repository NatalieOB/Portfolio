<strong>The Ask:</strong> Design a logo resembling graffiti art for an accent wall in the client's studio. My client requested a black font on a pink background and a rainbow of paint splatters, like the intentional flickering of a paintbrush.

<strong>The Process:</strong> For inspiration, I researched the greater Boston area and delivered my first round of sketches. While sketching several concepts of the graffiti styles that inspired me, I considered my client's persona and the customers who visited her studio. It was also crucial for her logo to be impactful, memorable, and convey artistic expression. I created several versions utilizing spray paint techniques for the graffiti motif.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> After several iterations, which included refining my sketches and communicating with the client, we ended up with an intentional and impactful design. Through close collaboration with my client, I developed a versatile logo that aligned with her brand identity.
