<strong>The Ask:</strong> Produced the Commonwealth midyear outlook in its first infographic format, with supporting 30-second videos for social. The goal was also to include a client-facing version of the outlook. Social posts were formatted for the accompanying videos, additionally organic social copy, and CTAs drove traffic to the outlook on public site, IMO, and COMMunity Link web pages.

<strong>The Process:</strong> Very typically, this industry-leading financial firm also required supporting data visualizations and infographics. I made sure to keep this simple, clean and on-point. It was critical to work with the creative director, Subject Matter Experts, and the project manager to break down information and draw attention to insights and processes and bring data and key numbers to life with a simple and clean graphic style.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> The project was met with a hard deadline. With it being the first material done without having to be printed it changed the way it was produced in its future deliverables.
