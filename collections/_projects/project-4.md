<strong>Types of Post:</strong> Photo, video, carousel/gallery, infographic

<strong>The Process:</strong> Visual assets have a big job. Alongside with working with a copywriter, creative director, and the social media strategist we executed and achieved one or more of the following goals: Drawing attention to press releases and conferences, provided logistical details for event posts, educated the audience with information about with our market outlook infographics, entertained with bloopers and videos of our roundtable discussion segments, piqued emotion  with our advisor/employee spotlights.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> Always made sure we kept to the brand messaging and design elements. When the using photography or visuals that include people, make sure they are kept as the focal point. Kept a checklist that asked the question, would it stop me from scrolling? Is it impactful? Is it compositionally interesting? #nailedit â€¦.
