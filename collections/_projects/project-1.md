<strong>The Ask:</strong> As the firm’s flagship print publication, it was always a standard that the Commonwealth Business Review should be engaging, modern, and always current with topics and visuals that supported the content. CBR is an award-winning publication that features insights, best practices, and tips for taking advantage of available resources from their in-house subject matter specialists. 

<strong>The Process:</strong> Acting as the lead designer, my first course of action was to sit down with several colleagues on the Editorial team to gather pertinent information that would help to restructure the rebrand and new way of communicating our stellar publication. I learned what was essential to explore, highlight, and incorporate into the design.

<strong>The Solution:</strong> A thought-provoking and radical rebrand was introduced with a whole new set of rules and branding hard points. A visual system developed and implemented to express the newest brand purpose and strategy.

It allowed for this bold new system to be defined as a striking combination of visual and verbal elements, each informed by Commonwealth Financial Network design principles. The industry and thematic photography styles and data were used to convey the firm's understanding of Commonwealth’s practice management and marketing, to financial and estate planning, to information security industry and their expertise with both big-picture concepts and focused engagement.

The image search was unique to our way of designing data visuals and incorporating photography that was more customized to our culture and community, and most importantly of our advisors. 

<strong>Skillset highlight</strong>
In each case, either through my own expertise, or through art direction, a fair amount of expert photo retouching was often required, for fit, scale and color, as well as removing unnecessary distractions.
